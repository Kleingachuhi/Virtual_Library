   - Enter:
     ```
     Book title: Harry Potter

   - *Tip: List authors first to find correct IDs*

   - Select `1` (Add) ‚Üí `3` (User)
   - Just enter a username (card number generates automatically)

4. **Create a Loan**:
   - Select `1` (Add) ‚Üí `4` (Loan)

     ```
     Book ID: 1
     User ID: 1
     ```

###  Updating Records
1. Select `2` (Update) from main menu
2. Choose what to update (Author=1, Book=2, etc.)
3. Example - Update a Book:
   ```
   Enter Book ID to update: 1
   New Title (or blank to skip): Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
   New Author ID (or blank to skip): [press Enter to skip]
   ```

### Deleting Records
1. Select `3` (Delete) from main menu
2. Choose what to delete
3. Example - Delete User:
   ```
   Enter User ID to delete: 1
   ```

###  Listing Records
1. Select `4` (List) from main menu
2. Choose what to list:
   - Authors (`1`): Shows all authors
   - Books (`2`): Shows titles with author names
   - Users (`3`): Shows usernames and card numbers
   - Loans (`4`): Shows borrowing history

###  Returning Books
1. Go to Update ‚Üí Loan (`2` ‚Üí `4`)
2. Enter Loan ID
3. For `Returned At`, enter today's date:
   ```
   New Returned At (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS): 2023-11-15 14:30:00
   ```
   or leave blank to mark as still borrowed

## Database Structure  

- **Authors**: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `birth_year`  
- **Books**: `id`, `title`, `author_id` (linked to Authors)  
- **Users**: `id`, `username`, `card_number`  
- **Loans**: `book_id`, `user_id`, `borrowed_at`, `returned_at`  

##  Pro Tips and guidance --
- Use `List` before updating/deleting to check IDs
- Loans automatically record borrow dates
- Card numbers are 6-digit auto-generated IDs
- All data saves to `library.db` (SQLite)

## Note
- No data is lost if you exit accidentally
